# Face Detection Using OpenCV

This is a simple real-time face detection project built using Python and OpenCV.

The program captures video from the webcam and detects faces using Haarcascade pre-trained models. 
It draws rectangles around detected faces and displays live instructions to the user.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Displays "Face" label on detected faces
- Instruction shown on screen ("Press 'q' to Quit")
- Proper exit handling (no window freeze)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2 library)

Install OpenCV using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
